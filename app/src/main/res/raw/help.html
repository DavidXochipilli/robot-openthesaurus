        <h2>What is a synonym?</h2>
        If two or more words have the same meaning in a specific context, they are synonyms.<br/>
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adresse, Anschrift</strong></li>
            <li><strong>gelingen, glücken, klappen</strong></li>
            <li><strong>oft, häufig</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether two words are synonymous can be easily tested with a made-up sentence like <strong>Ich gehe oft ins Kino</strong>. In this case, <strong>oft</strong> can be replaced by <strong>häufig</strong> without changing the meaning of the sentence. Hence, <strong>oft</strong> and <strong>häufig</strong> are synonyms.</p>
        The following pairs of words, on the other hand, are not synonymous:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>warm, heiß</strong> (the meaning differs too much)</li>
            <li><strong>Haus, Gebäude</strong> (Haus is a hyponym of Gebäude, not a synonym)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Synonyms of the same meaning form a synonym group. A word with several meanings &ndash; e.g. <strong>Bank</strong> &ndash; will appear in as many synonym groups as it has meanings:</p>
        Synonym group 1: <strong>Bank, Kreditinstitut</strong><br/>
        Synonym group 2: <strong>Bank, Sitzbank</strong>
